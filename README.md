This repository contains my Password Security & Authentication Analysis task, focusing on how passwords are securely created, stored, verified, and protected against cyber attacks. The task explores password hashing techniques, common attack methods, and best practices for strong authentication.

📄 Contents
- Password security fundamentals
- Difference between hashing and encryption
- Password storage using hashing
- Hashcat working principle
- Hash types: MD5, SHA-1, bcrypt
- Password hash generation
- Weak password cracking using wordlists
- Dictionary attack vs brute-force attack
- Why weak passwords fail
- Importance of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

🔍 Key Concepts
- Hashing is a one-way process used for secure password storage
- Encryption is reversible and not ideal for passwords
- MD5 & SHA-1 are insecure and vulnerable to attacks
- bcrypt is secure, slow, and resistant to brute-force attacks
- Hashcat recreates hashes from guesses instead of decrypting passwords

🧠 Tools & References
- Hashcat
- Google (research)
- ChatGPT (concept understanding & documentation support)

🎓 Purpose
- This task was completed as part of my academic learning to understand password security, authentication mechanisms, and attack prevention techniques used in modern cybersecurity systems.
